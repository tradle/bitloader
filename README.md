# bitloader
This implementation writes to our Lablz Web Database (Lablz is not open source yet). 
It was easier for us to make it work with Lablz as we could instantly start using it in our existing apps. 
Since this component is open and is very small, you can fork it to make your own bitloader, 
whether into your choice of NoSQL, the MySQL, Quickbooks, Salesforce, Oracle or anything you need.
